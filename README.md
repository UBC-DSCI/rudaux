## Rudaux 

Rudaux provides automated grading workflow orchestration for courses that use a
learning management system (LMS) (e.g. Canvas, EdX) with external tools (e.g.
JupyterHub and NbGrader).  Rudaux schedules and coordinates collecting assignments,
automatic and manual grading, grade upload, TA and instructor task
notification, automatic assignment extensions for late registrants, solution
and feedback return, and more.

Rudaux is named after the French artist and astronomer Lucien Rudaux, a pioneer
in space artistry and one of the first artists to paint Jupiter.

### Repository Status

This repository has been used for some time in teaching DSCI100: Introduction
to Data Science at the University of British Columbia.  We use Rudaux to
coordinate Canvas, a JupyterHub where students work on assignments, and the
NbGrader notebook autograder. 

The repo is currently in progress towards a first general version that is 
not specific to these tools and can be used more widely. Work is underway 
in the `Version 1.0` project in the `prefect-by-assignment` branch.
